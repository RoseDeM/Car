Its important you read the comments written on the files as you will understand where to put the files or what part you can configure, 
your model file shouldn't be a single mesh or this won't work, it should have 4 wheels and a single body [bare minimum requirements] for this file to work. 

other information will be provided in form of //comments// in specific files only.
